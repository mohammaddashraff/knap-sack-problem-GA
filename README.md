## About the Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack Problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack of limited capacity, without exceeding the weight limit.

This problem is NP-hard, making it a challenging optimization problem with practical applications in various fields such as resource allocation, finance, and logistics.

## Genetic Algorithm Approach

This repository provides a solution to the Knapsack Problem using a Genetic Algorithm. Genetic Algorithms are a nature-inspired optimization technique that uses evolution principles like selection, crossover, and mutation to find an optimal or near-optimal solution. The algorithm evolves a population of potential solutions to the problem and converges towards an optimal solution over time.
